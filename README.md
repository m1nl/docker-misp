# About the repo

This is a fork of [CoolAcid's MISP Docker images](https://github.com/coolacid/docker-misp), which is great, but I needed to tune it better to run in Kubernetes environment. You can find sample Kubernetes manifests in kubernetes-manifests directory.

The usage of this repo is quite similar to CoolAcid's, so if you are already familiar with it, you'll be able to run it without issues (however there are some ENV names changes, so please look at docker-compose file carefully).
